projection.js is an implementation of the basic 3d orthogonal/perspective projection algorithms.
The purpose was to learn the basics of the computer graphics field , also to learn more about javascript.
Tested only on chrome , sorry for that.

Currently implemented :
-drawing points/lines/triangles.
-rotation and zoom.
-BSP to order the rastering of triangles.
-basic rendering which includes
--anti-aliasing
--simple lightening (diffuse shading , phong lightening , ambient lightening)
--shadows
--reflections (need more testing , disabled by default)
